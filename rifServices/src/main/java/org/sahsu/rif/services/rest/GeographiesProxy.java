/*
 * Code Road Map:
 * --------------
 * Code is organised into the following sections.  Wherever possible, 
 * methods are classified based on an order of precedence described in 
 * parentheses (..).  For example, if you're trying to find a method 
 * 'getName(...)' that is both an interface method and an accessor 
 * method, the order tells you it should appear under interface.
 * 
 * Order of 
 * Precedence     Section
 * ==========     ======
 * (1)            Section Constants
 * (2)            Section Properties
 * (3)            Section Construction
 * (7)            Section Accessors and Mutators
 * (6)            Section Errors and Validation
 * (5)            Section Interfaces
