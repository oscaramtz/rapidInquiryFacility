# Welcome to the rapidInquiryFacility

## Overview

The Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) is a freely-available software application that supports two types of environmental health activities:

- disease mapping studies
- risk analysis studies.

It is designed to help epidemiologists and public health researchers to rapidly investigate potential environmental hazards, especially those related to industrial sites. It uses health, environmental, socio-economic, population and geographic data to calculate risks in relation to sources of exposure and to generate maps.
