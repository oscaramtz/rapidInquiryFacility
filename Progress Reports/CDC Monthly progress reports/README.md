## September to December 2015

Completion activities on the RIF Postgres database: Postgres database test harness, partitioning; database trigger testing, confirm port to Linux. 

### 2016

## January to March 2016

Created a basic shapefile Conversion service: convert existing TopoJSON convertor to a web service, (Linux) compressed file support, instrumentation, exception (error) 
handlers, diagnostics, test harness. Design of web services, code refactor for multiple services; shapefile conversion to geoJSON, multiple shapefile support; display 
of shapefile GeoJSON in a web browser using Leaflet (RIF mapping library).

## April to June 2016

Matured service to process with all the required file types; added full function web front end. All data required by the backend can now be setup by the front end web
form; with information defaulted where possible. In detail: Made backend asynchronous (Node.js runs as a single process so the code has to be written so that is split 
in ordered chunks of parallel processing). Added zip file support; large (>1GB) file support, saved XML configuration, simplification, TopoJSON and zoomlevel 6-11 support, 
refactor and removal of duplicate code. JQuery UI frontend, zip, dbf and ESRI extended attributes file support.
